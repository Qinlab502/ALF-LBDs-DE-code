## Introduction
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are valuable alternatives to traditional antibiotics that possess a variety of potent biological activities by exerting immunomodulatory effects to clear difficult-to-treat infections. Understanding the structure-activity relationships (SARs) of AMPs can direct the synthesis of desirable therapeutics. In this work, we describe our development of a machine learning algorithm which help to accelerate the directed evolution (DE) of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that are valuable alternatives to traditional small-molecule antibiotics. LBDs-DE algorithm were developed as demo for accelerating the artificial modification of lipopolysaccharide-binding domain which acts as a functional domain of anti-lipopolysaccharide factor (ALF).

## Example usage 
The codes were written in jupyter notebook and the test can be run from the top level directory.
